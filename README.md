# Project_detection_fine_dust_temperature_humidity
Project for the detection of fine dust, temperature and humidity.

Cards and sensors used:
  - ESP8266 data acquisition, management and transmission card.
  - SDS011 fine dust detection sensor, specifically PM 2.5 and PM 10.
  - DHT22 temperature and humidity detection sensor.

The project is divided into two source codes, one to be loaded into the ESP8266 board which detects the data through the sensors and another for the real-time reading of the information and its transcription in a text file with the relative wave function.
